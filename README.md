# universify-test

`universify` is an upcoming SSR microframework.

It is ESM-first, built 100% on ESM code, including the CLI.

Help us do some preliminary tests on the feasibility of ESM CLIs.

Run `npm i` and then `npx uni app`, are you able to boot the server?

If not, please open an issue detailing your setup (Node and NPM version).

**Node v14+ required**.
